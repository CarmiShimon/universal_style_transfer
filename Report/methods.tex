\hspace{0.5cm} Our project contains the following tasks: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Building and training the models required for Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms as described in \cite{bib11}.
	\item Implementing a PyTorch program to perform the UST algorithm as described in \cite{bib11}.
	\item Present innovative method to enhance the style transfer effect. This method shall be referred to as \textit{boosting}.
	\item In \cite{bib11}, Li et al present a method to transfer style from a pair of style images, in such a way that the result will contain stylistic aspects of both. Let's refer to this problem as \textit{Merge}-UST. In this task we research methods that utilize the UST framework to perform Merge-UST in a computationally lighter fashion than presented in \cite{bib11}.
